1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.
a server exists with all the blockchain data on it. the users or miners get the transaction list
from the server. They also get the last block chain proof. The miners then have to create a hash
using some predetermined rules. You can think of the block as a group of transactions. A unique
signature is created by hashing the data. Now the next block of transactions signature is created
by using the previos blocks signature and hashing it together with the new transaction data. So 
if any data is changed it will make the signatures be invalid. This creates a near immutable data
storage system. 

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?
Miners get coins as a reward for generating a matching hash using predefined rules. Solving the
problems takes a lot of computer processing so it can be time consuming and costly. The mining has
to be done or the currency will pretty much collapse. Miners are only going to do it if they are
making something from the whole process. 

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.
The medical industry uses these type of simulations to model how virus's multiply. They can
model the effects of medication on the virus. It is also used to model the effects certain
species of animals have on eachother in the wilds. Scientists use this info to try and prevent
species from going extinct.
